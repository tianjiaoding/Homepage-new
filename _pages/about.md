<!-- Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com){:target="\_blank"}. You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/){:target="\_blank"} and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/){:target="\_blank"}, like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them. -->
I am a first-year Ph.D. student at [Johns Hopkins University](https://www.jhu.edu/){:target="\_blank"}, advised by [René Vidal](http://cis.jhu.edu/~rvidal/){:target="\_blank"}. Prior to joining Hopkins, I spent two years as a research assistant at [ShanghaiTech University](http://sist.shanghaitech.edu.cn/){:target="\_blank"}, advised by [Manolis C. Tsakiris](https://sites.google.com/site/manolisctsakiris/){:target="\_blank"} and collaborating with [Laurent Kneip](https://laurentkneip.com/){:target="\_blank"}. I received my undergraduate degree in computer science with honor from [ShanghaiTech](http://sist.shanghaitech.edu.cn/){:target="\_blank"}, working with [Manolis](https://sites.google.com/site/manolisctsakiris/){:target="\_blank"} and [Yi Ma](http://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~yima/){:target="\_blank"}.

My research interests lie in the theoretical foundations of machine learning and data science as well as emerging applications. As such, I develop both rigorous mathematics and practical implementations in my work. In particular, I study subspace learning, 3D vision, and robotics.
